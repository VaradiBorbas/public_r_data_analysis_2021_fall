# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
# Reading the data
cocktail_data <- read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")

# Selecting the variables that are needed for completing the assignment
cocktail_data <- select(cocktail_data, 'name', 'ingredients')
```


## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
# Separating the data into multiple lines
cocktail_data <- separate_rows(cocktail_data, ingredients, sep = "<br/>", convert = TRUE)
cocktail_data <- separate_rows(cocktail_data, ingredients, sep = "<br>", convert = TRUE)
cocktail_data <- separate_rows(cocktail_data, ingredients, sep = "<b4/>", convert = TRUE)

# Getting rid of quantities etc.
cocktail_data$ingredients <- str_remove_all(cocktail_data$ingredients, "[0-9,/,.]")
cocktail_data$ingredients <- str_remove_all(cocktail_data$ingredients, "\\(% abv\\)")
cocktail_data$ingredients <- str_remove_all(cocktail_data$ingredients, "oz")
cocktail_data$ingredients <- str_remove_all(cocktail_data$ingredients, "drops")
cocktail_data$ingredients <- str_remove_all(cocktail_data$ingredients, "drop")
cocktail_data$ingredients <- str_remove_all(cocktail_data$ingredients, "dashes")
cocktail_data$ingredients <- str_remove_all(cocktail_data$ingredients, "dash")
cocktail_data$ingredients <- str_remove_all(cocktail_data$ingredients, "bsp")
cocktail_data$ingredients <- str_replace(cocktail_data$ingredients, "  "," ")
cocktail_data$ingredients <- str_trim(cocktail_data$ingredients)
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
# Creating a dataframe containing only the ingredients variable, and renaming the header
ingredients_df <- as.data.frame(cocktail_data$ingredients)
ingredients_df <- rename(ingredients_df, "ingredients"="cocktail_data$ingredients" )

# Removing duplicates and ordering the list alphabetically
ingredients_list <- distinct(ingredients_df)
ingredients_list <- arrange(ingredients_list, ingredients)
ingredients_list
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
# Counting the total number of ingredients (once each ingredient)
count(ingredients_list)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
# Counting the occurrence of each ingredient and selecting the top 10 most frequent
group_by(ingredients_df, ingredients) %>% tally() %>% top_n(10)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

```{r}
# Showing the cocktails that has the most ingredients
group_by(cocktail_data, name) %>% tally() %>% top_n(1)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

```{r}
# Showing the number of ingredients that appear in only one cocktail
group_by(ingredients_df, ingredients) %>% tally() %>% filter(n==1) %>% tally()
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
# Showing the cocktails that has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail
rare_ingredients = group_by(ingredients_df, ingredients) %>% tally() %>% filter(n==1) %>% ungroup()
cocktails_with_rare <- inner_join(cocktail_data, rare_ingredients)
cocktails_with_rare <- select(cocktails_with_rare, name) %>% distinct()
cocktails_with_rare
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
# Showing the cocktails that have no rare ingredients
cocktails_without_rare <- select(cocktail_data, name) %>% distinct()
cocktails_without_rare <- anti_join(cocktails_without_rare, cocktails_with_rare)
(cocktails_without_rare)
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}
# Preparation for the cheat sheet
cheat_sheet <- distinct(cocktail_data)
cheat_sheet <- add_column(cheat_sheet, values = "X")

# Transforming the table to wide format and changing "NA"s to empty
cheat_sheet2 <- pivot_wider(cheat_sheet, names_from = ingredients, values_from = values, values_fill = "")
cheat_sheet2
```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
